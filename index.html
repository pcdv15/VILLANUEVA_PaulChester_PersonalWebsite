        <p>I am Paul Chester D. Villanueva, currently a BSIT student of the <a href="http://www.usep.edu.ph/">University of Southeastern Philippines</a>. I was born on January 15th of the year 1998 on Milagros, Masbate. I spent my elementary days at Milagros East Central School and my highschool years at Liceo de San Jose.</p>
        <p>My hobbies include reading, writing, playing video games, programming, listening to music, and watching movies. I am a person with considerable skill in my field. My experience over the years as a programmer gave me insight and foresight when I am at work. I am confident with my skills.</p>
        <p>I am the youngest child in my family with two older brothers. As a child, I was always surrounded with books and reading them opened my mind to the wonders of literature, science, and philosophy. My personal motto is <i>&quotKnowledge is power&quot</i>.</p>
